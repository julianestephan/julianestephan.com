        <h2>Background</h2>
		<p> I am currently an Operating Partner at BayPine. BayPine seeks to be the private equity partner of choice for market-leading companies in core industries 			that want to unlock their long-term potential through digital transformation, driving innovation, and accelerating sustainable growth. I architect and execute value-creation strategies to accelerate the growth of our portfolio companies. I am a hands-on leader that specializes in unlocking value through operational excellence and digital transformation. Starting with the due diligence process, this includes close collaboration with portfolio company leadership on strategy, budgets, and talent - which continues through the hold period until exit. With a proven track record in private equity and consulting, I have driven significant EBITDA growth, scaled businesses, and delivered sustainable impact across diverse sectors including multi-site healthcare, industrial manufacturing, distribution, and technology in North America, Europe, and Asia. </p>

<p> Previously, I was a Principal at Incline Equity Partners, a middle market private equity firm headquartered in Pittsburgh and was one of the first employees on the Catalyst team. Prior to that, I was an Associate Partner at Bain & Company where I had the pleasure to collaborate with the World Economic Forum on "Circular Transformation of Industries" and help develop Bain's sustainable and transparent supply chain consulting offering.  Before joining Bain, I was with PwC Strategy& for over 8 years where I built the Digital Operations integrated solution offering, and co-led the Smart Factory team in the US. </p>

<p> To drive impact, I lean on my passion for uncovering hidden behavior drivers, fostering cross-functional collaboration, approaching complex problems with a first-principles mindset, and helping teams and individuals to maximize their impact. I seek to combine rigorous analysis, balancing system-wide perspectives with detailed micro-level insights, with creative solutions to drive outcomes. I find it very rewarding to partner with driven executives and founders who want to accelerate the growth of their business and to support them with my (digital) transformation expertise. </p>

<p> I studied the CEMS Master in International Management at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, Austria, and the University of Sydney, Australia. Prior to this, I completed an interdisciplinary Bachelor degree in Corporate Management & Economics at Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen, Germany. I have lived and worked in the USA, Germany, Austria, Australia, Spain, Japan, and China. </p>

<p> Originally from Germany, I now live in Miami with my partner. I am a passionate equestrian and am competing in show jumping with my mare Sweet Caroline. </p>
